{{< about-section
    title="Who am I?"
    content="<p class='lead'>An engineer at heart and a problem-solver by nature, I channel curiosity and energy into creating technology that simplifies lives. Leadership, for me, means rolling up my sleeves: you'll find me debugging code with engineers one hour and aligning product strategy the next. I'm a <strong>deliberate generalist</strong>, a T-shaped professional with a hybrid toolkit: part technical architect, part team builder. After founding a startup, I learned to bridge business vision and technical executionâ€”scaling systems, mentoring teams, and advocating for user-centric design. My leadership thrives on three principles: <ol><li><strong>Iterative Improvement:</strong> I foster teams that treat progress as a cycle of experimentation, feedback, and refinement.</li><li><strong>Radical Transparency:</strong> From blocks to wins, I believe open communication builds trust and aligns goals.</li><li><strong>Empathy as a Superpower:</strong> Understanding diverse perspectivesâ€”whether engineers, clients, or end-usersâ€”fuels better decisions and stronger collaboration.</li></ol><br/><strong>My superpower?</strong> Versatility. From architecting backend systems (Node.js, Java or PHP) or mobile apps, to optimizing CI/CD pipelines, I connect dots across disciplines to build products that resonate. But technology alone isn't the answer: I obsess over <em>how</em> teams work, fostering environments where psychological safety and iterative learning drive innovation."
